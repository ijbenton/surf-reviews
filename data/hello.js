    'The Ghost has been developed with the Pyzel Team riders over a number of years to give you a board that performs in Bigger Better Waves. With full volume through the front section combined with a lower rocker, the Ghost can really fly while the round tail and double concave in the lower half help keep you in control. \n \n The Pyzel Ghost goes best in more powerful waves like reef breaks, drainy, dumpy beach breaks or when you want to draw long lines on your favourite point break.',
